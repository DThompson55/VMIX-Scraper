Copy spreadsheet URL and paste in application

Hmmm... does the spreadsheet have to be shared with the app URL first?

SHOW The spreadsheet name.

app opens spreadsheet, determines if it is VMIX compatible
there are two sheets, and we get their names,

sheet 1 has rows/columns appropriate to VMIX
Col A has forumla that references Col B
Col B has validation that uses 2nd sheet

2nd sheet has two cols with VMIX names, and are sorted


If Col A is not set, there's nothing we can do yet.
If Col B is not set, there's nothing we can do yet.
If Sheet 2 is not set, ie has no columns, we can ask to add them
If Sheet 2 is has columns but wrong names we can ask to add them
If Sheet 2 is has columns but not sorted we can ask to add them
If Sheet 2 is has columns but doesn't match VMIX we can ask to add them

OR we can automatically add the each time it is run, which is good enough for 0.1
Just overwrite whatever is in sheet 2, regardless of name.

So this is really VMIX helper, but instead of an excel file, it takes a URL.
